# Image_captioning

Generating natural language descriptions of given images, known as image captioning,
has attracted great academic and industrial interest since it can be widely used in
image text cross-searching, early childhood education and eye-handicapped people
assistance. Compared with other computer vision tasks, e.g. image classification,
object detection and semantic segmenta- tion, image captioning is a more challenging
and comprehensive task as it requires a fine-grain understanding of image objects as
well as their attributes and relationships. It has huge potential for replacing manual
caption generation for images and is especially suitable for large scale image data.
